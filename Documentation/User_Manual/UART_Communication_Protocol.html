		<h1 align="center">UART communication protocol</h1>
		
		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			System provides two commands, <i>download</i> and <i>upload</i>, that allow to transfer files to and from the system using the serial port.<br />
			Both commands connect through the UART to a server running on another PC (the Lemon system is the client).<br />
			This page describes how the commands communicate with the remote server.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Protocol</h2>
		<h3>Download command protocol</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Client connects to the server.</li>
			<li>Client sends the <i>download</i> command, followed by the file name.</li>
			<li>Server replies <i>acknowledge</i> or <i>abort</i> if the requested file is not found.</li>
			<li>Server sends the file size.</li>
			<li>Clients replies <i>acknowledge</i> or <i>abort</i> (if there is not enough free space to store the file on the client disk).</li>
			<li>Server sends the whole file.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>Upload command protocol</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Client connects to the server.</li>
			<li>Client sends the <i>upload</i> command, followed by the file name.</li>
			<li>Server replies <i>acknowledge</i> or <i>abort</i>.</li>
			<li>Client sends the file size.</li>
			<li>Server replies <i>acknowledge</i> or <i>abort</i> (if there is not enough free space to store the file on the server disk).</li>
			<li>Client sends the whole file.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>Connection establishment</h3>
		<p>
			Client sends repeatedly the <b>PROTOCOL_COMMAND_CONNECT</b> byte until it receives the <b>PROTOCOL_COMMAND_ACKNOWLEDGE</b> byte from the server.<br />
			Server waits infinitely for the <b>PROTOCOL_COMMAND_CONNECT</b> byte. When it receives this byte, it sends the <b>PROTOCOL_COMMAND_ACKNOWLEDGE</b> byte to the client.<br />
			On the server side, there is no need to discard superfluous <b>PROTOCOL_COMMAND_CONNECT</b> bytes received from the client because the next protocol expected byte is always different from <b>PROTOCOL_COMMAND_CONNECT</b> value.
		</p>
		
		<h3>File transfer</h3>
		<p>
			File data are sent 512 bytes at a time, then the sender waits for a <b>PROTOCOL_COMMAND_ACKNOWLEDGE</b> sent from the receiver. Last block of data may be less than 512 bytes.
		</p>

		<h3>Commands definition</h3>
		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<th>Command</th>
				<th>ASCII value</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>PROTOCOL_COMMAND_CONNECT</td>
				<td>'C'</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>PROTOCOL_COMMAND_DOWNLOAD</td>
				<td>'D'</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>PROTOCOL_COMMAND_UPLOAD</td>
				<td>'U'</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>PROTOCOL_COMMAND_ACKNOWLEDGE</td>
				<td>'A'</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>PROTOCOL_COMMAND_ABORT</td>
				<td>'E' ('e' stands for error)</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<h3>Data format</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>File size is sent in little endian format and is 4-byte long (corresponding to C language <i>unsigned int</i> type).</li>
			<li>File name is an ASCII string with up to 12 characters. If the string is shorter than 12 characters, the string must be terminated by a terminating zero. If the string length is equal to 12 characters, the terminating zero is omitted.</li>
		</ul>
